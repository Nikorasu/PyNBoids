# PyNBoids

### A Python Boids Simulation

This is a [Boids simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids "Wikipedia"),
written in Python3 with Pygame2.

![Preview](preview.gif "Preview")

**To use** save the `pynboids.py` file somewhere (and `nboids.png` if you want
it's icon, not required), and run via python. (Example: `python3 pynboids.py`)

`Esc` key to quit.

I've included several tweakable settings near the top of the code. You can
adjust window size, fullscreen, fps, and how many boids to spawn, as well as
whether boids avoid screen edges or wrap to the other side.. Change the
background color, or turn the Boids into fish! ;) More in the future..
